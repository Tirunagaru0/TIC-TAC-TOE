# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O) to achieve three in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or if all squares are filled, resulting in a draw. It's simple yet strategic fun!
